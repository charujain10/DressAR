# Project Structure

## Backend

The backend is built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, providing REST APIs for user registration, login, product listing, and order placement. Data is stored in a **MongoDB** database. The backend code can be found in the `backend` directory.

## Frontend

The frontend is developed using **React.js**, offering a user interface for registration, login, product listing, and shopping cart functionality. It also integrates AR/VR technology for virtual clothing try-ons. The frontend code is located in the `frontend` directory.
